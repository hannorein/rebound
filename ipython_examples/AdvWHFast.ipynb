    "There are several performance enhancements one can make to WHFast.  However, each one has pitfalls that an inexperienced user can unwittingly fall into.  We therefore chose safe default settings that make the integrator difficult to misuse.  **This makes the default WHFast substantially slower and less accurate than it can be**.  Here we describe how to alter the integrator settings to improve WHFast's performance.\n",

    "1. you don't add, remove or otherwise modify particles between timesteps\n",

    "you can set `sim.integrator_whfast_safemode = 0` to get a substantial performance boost.  Under the same stipulations, you can set `sim.integrator_whfast_corrector = 11` to get much higher accuracy, at a nearly negligible loss of performance (as long as there are many timesteps between outputs).\n",

    "The Wisdom-Holman algorithm consists of alternating *Keplerian* steps that evolve particles on their two-body Keplerian orbits around the star with *interaction* steps that apply impulses to the particles' velocities from the interactions between bodies.

In order to get the particles' actual positions, we would have to calculate to the end the timestep we want the output for by splitting a full *Kepler* step back into two half-steps, e.g.,\n",

    "We call this step of reinserting half-Kepler steps to obtain the physical state of the particles *synchronizing*.  This must be done whenever the **actual** states of the particles are required, e.g., before every output, or if one wanted to use the particles' states to compute additional changes to the particle orbits between timesteps.  It is also necessary to synchronize each timestep whenever the MEGNO chaos indicator is being computed.\n",

    "**Conversions between Jacobi and Inertial Coordinates**\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the most convenient coordinate system to work in for performing the Kepler steps is Jacobi coordinates (see, e.g., 9.5.4 of Murray & Dermott).  WHFast therefore works in Jacobi coordinates, converting to inertial coordinates when it needs to (e.g. for output, and for doing the direct gravity calculation in the interaction step, which is most easily done in inertial coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "One feature of WHFast is that it works in whatever inertial coordinate system you choose for your initial conditions.  This means that whatever happens behind the scenes, the user always gets the particles' inertial coordinates at the front end.  At the beginning of every timestep, WHFast therefore has to somehow obtain the Jacobi coordinates.  The straightforward thing would be to convert from the inertial coordinates to Jacobi coordinates every timestep, but these conversions slow things down, and they represent extra operations that grow the round-off error.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHFast therefore stores the Jacobi coordinates internally throughout the time it is running, and only recalculates Jacobi coordinates from the inertial ones if told to do so.  Since Jacobi coordinates reference particles to the center of mass of all the particles with indices lower than their own (typically all the particles interior to them), the main reason you would have to recalculate Jacobi coordinates is if between timesteps you choose to somehow change the particles' positions or velocities (give them kicks in addition to their mutual gravity), or change the particles' masses.  \n",
