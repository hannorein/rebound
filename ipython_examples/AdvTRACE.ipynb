    "# Advanced settings for TRACE:  Speedups for large-N systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to WHFAST (see [AdvWHFast.ipynb](../AdvWHFast)), TRACE has a \"safe mode\" setting that is on by default, but can be turned off for a speed boost. The specific speedups detailed here are **only** useful for systems with large N -- around $N \\gtrsim 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR**\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as you don't add, remove or otherwise modify particles between timesteps, you can set `sim.ri_trace.safe_mode = 0` for up to a $\\%$ performance boost. If you want to modify particles, or if the code breaks with these advanced settings, read below for details."

    "**The TRACE algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The speedup from turning off safe mode come from reducing the computational overhead associated with the various checks used in the TRACE algorithm. Here we briefly walk through the algorithm -- see Lu, Hernandez & Rein (2024) for more details. In one TRACE step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every pair of particles is checked for close encounters, a mutual separation criterion informed by each particle's Hill radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The integration itself happens, with either Wisdom-Holman or Bulirsch-Stoer depending on close encounters\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Every pair of particles is checked again for close encounters. If any pair of particles initially not in a close encounter is in one after the timestep, the step is rejected. We then re-run the step, demanding that the new particle pair is integrated with the close encounter prescription.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three steps scale as $O(N^2)$ where $N$ is particle number, and it turns out that in the limit of large $N$ the overhead from checks (Steps 1 & 3) actually dominates over the actual integration time (Steps 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "For a pure $N$-body code there is no getting around this $O(N^2)$ bottleneck, but one thing we can do is recycle the post-timestep close encounter check. In the event that after Step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The step is not rejected\n",
    "* No particles are changed between timesteps\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the simulation state at the end of Step 3 is exactly the same as the state at the beginning of Step 1 of the next timestep. Step 1 is thus a redundant calculation, and we can safely skip it provided the two conditions above are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overriding the defaults**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by importing rebound, and defining a simple function to reset rebound and initialize a new simulation with a large $N$. Specifically, we use a protoplanetary disk inspired by Chambers (2013)."
