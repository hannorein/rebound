    "\n",
    "REBOUND comes with a ipython widget that can be used in Jupyter notebooks. It is similar to the OpenGL visualization in the C version of REBOUND, but it currently misses a few features such as rendering spheres and support for periodic boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the widget makes setting up a simulation very interactive. One can spot many mistakes in the setup process of a simulation by visually inspecting the  particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The widget is using the ipywidgets package which needs to be installed and enabled. More information on this can be found in the ipywidgets documentation at https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html. You also need a browser and a graphics card that supports WebGL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start this demo by setting up an empty simulation and calling the `widget()` function on the simulation object. This will create a new widget, attach it to the simulation and return it to the user. "
