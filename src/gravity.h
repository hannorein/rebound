 * @brief 	Calculate gravitational forces. 
 * @author 	Hanno Rein <hanno@hanno-rein.de>
 *
 * @details 	The code supports different methods for calculating the
 * gravitational forces. They all use this common interface. It is assumed
 * that the gravitational forces are independent of velocity. They are 
 * calculated by gravity_calculate_acceleration() which is called in the 
 * middle (K) part of the DKD timestepping scheme.
