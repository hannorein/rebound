 * @brief 	Leap-frog integration scheme.
 * @author 	Hanno Rein <hanno@hanno-rein.de>
 * @detail	This file implements the leap-frog integration scheme.  
 * This scheme is second order accurate, symplectic and well suited for 
 * non-rotating coordinate systems. Note that the scheme is formally only
 * first order accurate when velocity dependend forces are present.
