 * @brief  	Handles communication between nodes using MPI.
 * @author 	Hanno Rein <hanno@hanno-rein.de>
 *
 * @details 	These routines handle the communication between
 * different nodes via the Message Passing Interface (MPI). 
 * There are two different types of communications
 * implemented at the moment:
 * - Distributing particles to the correct node.
 * - Creating, and distributing the essential tree to allow
 *   other nodes walk remote trees. Note that the opening 
 *   criteria is different for gravity and collision 
 *   tree walks.
