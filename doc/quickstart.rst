Quick User Quide
================

You can call REBOUND from C or Python. Which programming language you want to use depends on your taste and your specific application. In short: If you simply want to setup a few particles such as a planetary system, visualize it with a WebGL widget, and integrate it with the high order integrator IAS15 or the new symplectic integrator WHFast then use the Python version. If you want to run large simulations with millions of particles, use an exotic integrator, use fast OpenGL visualizations, or make use of the distributed tree code then use the C version. 

We provide two quickstart guides, one for C and one for Python:
