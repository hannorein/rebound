REBOUND is an N-body integrator, i.e. a software package that can integrate the motion of particles under the influence of gravity. The particles can represent stars, planets, moons, ring or dust particles. REBOUND is very flexible and can be customized to accurately and efficiently solve many problems in astrophysics.  An incomplete feature list of REBOUND:

* Symplectic integrators (WHFast, WHFastHelio, SEI, LEAPFROG)
* High accuracy non-symplectic integrator with adaptive timestepping (IAS15)
* Support for collisional/granular dynamics, various collision detection routines
* The code is written entirely in C, conforms to the ISO standard C99 and can be used as a thread-safe shared library
* Easy-to-use Python module, installation in 3 words: `pip install rebound`
* Extensive set of example problems in both C and Python
* Real-time, 3D OpenGL visualization (C version)
* Parallelized with OpenMP (for shared memory systems)
* Parallelized with MPI using an essential tree for gravity and collisions (for distributed memory systems)
* No libraries are needed, use of OpenGL/glfw3 for visualization is optional
* The code is fully open-source and can be downloaded freely from http://github.com/hannorein/rebound
* No configuration is needed to run any of the example problems. Just type `make && ./rebound` in the problem directory to run them
* Comes with standard ASCII or binary output routines 
* Different modules are easily interchangeable at runtime



How to use REBOUND - a quick introduction
-----------------------------------------
You can call REBOUND from C or Python. Which programming language you want to use depends on your taste and your specific application. In short: If you simply want to setup a few particles such as a planetary system, visualize it with a WebGL widget, and integrate it with the high order integrator IAS15 or the new symplectic integrator WHFast then use the Python version. If you want to run large simulations with millions of particles, use an exotic integrator, use fast OpenGL visualizations, or make use of the distributed tree code then use the C version. 

All the computationally expensive parts of REBOUND are written in C. So even if you use the Python version, you'll end up with a very fast code.

To install the *Python version*, simply type the following command into a terminal::

    pip install rebound

To learn more about how to use REBOUND with Python have a look at the iPython/Jupyter tutorials at https://github.com/hannorein/rebound/blob/master/ipython_examples/

To install the *C version*, clone this repository, e.g. by simply copy-and-pasting the following command into your terminal::
    
    git clone http://github.com/hannorein/rebound && cd rebound/examples/shearing_sheet && make && ./rebound

To learn more about how to use REBOUND with C, study the examples in the `examples/` directory and continue reading this file. You might also want to have a look at the `rebound.h` file in the `src/` directory which contains the API specifications. Last but not least, REBOUND is open source. If you want to know how something works, you can just look at the source code. And of course, you are welcome to e-mail any of the contributors with questions. We'll do our best to answer them quickly.

Note:  REBOUND does not work on Windows, and we currently do not have plans to support it.
